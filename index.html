    <title>Can’t Worry About It</title>
    <meta name="description" content="CWAI (Can’t Worry About It) is a wellness web app designed to help you pause, breathe, and reconnect with yourself  without pressure, performance, or perfection.
Created by Dr. Kenisha Elaine, CWAI supports high-capacity women who carry a lot but rarely get space to exhale. Through gentle check-ins, grounding tools, and reflective guidance, CWAI helps users understand their emotional capacity and receive support that meets them where they are.
At the heart of CWAI is the Capacity Checker™, a calming self-assessment that helps you tune into your energy, emotions, and needs in just a few minutes. From there, users receive personalized guidance, soft practices, and access to the CWAI Guide  a collection of reflections and tools designed to restore balance without overwhelm.
CWAI isn’t about fixing yourself.
It’s about honoring your capacity, protecting your peace, and moving through life with intention.">
